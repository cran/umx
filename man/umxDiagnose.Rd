\title{Diagnose problems in a model - this is a work in progress.}
\usage{
umxDiagnose(model, tryHard = FALSE, diagonalizeExpCov = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{an \code{\link{mxModel}} to diagnose}

\item{tryHard}{whether I should try and fix it? (defaults to FALSE)}

\item{diagonalizeExpCov}{Whether to diagonalize the ExpCov}
}
\value{
- helpful messages and perhaps a modified model
}
\description{
The goal of this function is to diagnose problems in a model and return suggestions to the user.
It is a work in progress, and probably is not of any use as yet.
